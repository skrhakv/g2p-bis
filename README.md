## Protein-Protein Interactions

### Introduction

Proteins are complex molecules that rely on various types of interactions to maintain their structure and function. Genomics 2 Proteins portal provide intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions at each residue positions. Intra-protein interactions are calculated from both AlphaFold and monomeric PDB structures, and inter-protein interactions are calculated from available multimeric PDB structures. 


1. **Hydrogen Bonds**
1. **Nonbonding Interactions**
1. **Disulfide Bonds**
1. **Salt Bridges**

These interactions play critical roles in stabilizing protein structures and facilitating biological functions. Hydrogen bonds, nonbonding interactions, and disulfide bonds are calculated from HBPLUSv.3.06 software (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/HBPLUS/). Salt-bridges are calculated from the included python script (src/PPI_salt_bridges.py)

### Interaction Types


#### 1. Hydrogen Bonds

**Hydrogen bonds** are interactions between a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom (donor) and another electronegative atom (acceptor). These are calculated using the software HBPLUS, which identifies potential hydrogen bonds based on geometric criteria. HBPLUS considers an interaction to qualify as a hydrogen bond if the donor-acceptor distance is less than 3.9 Ångströms and the hydrogen-acceptor distance is less than 2.5 Ångströms.


#### 2. Nonbonding Interactions

**Nonbonding interactions** include various types of interactions that do not involve covalent bonds or hydrogen bonds, such as van der Waals forces. HBPLUS is also used to calculate these interactions using its default settings where the distance between two residues is less than 3.9 Ångströms.

#### 3. Disulfide Bonds

**Disulfide bonds** are covalent bonds formed between the sulfur atoms of two cysteine residues. These bonds are crucial for stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of proteins. HBPLUS identifies these bonds based on the proximity (3.0 Ångströms) of sulfur atoms within the cysteine residues.

#### 4. Salt Bridges

A **salt bridge** is a type of non-covalent interaction between oppositely charged residues. In the provided script, salt bridges are calculated by identifying pairs of charged residues (Aspartic Acid (ASP), Glutamic Acid (GLU), Arginine (ARG), and Lysine (LYS)) and measuring the distance between their charged atoms. A salt bridge is considered present if the distance between a pair of oppositely charged atoms is less than 3.2 Ångströms.

## G2P APIs
Genomics To Proteins portal makes available two APIs, the G2P3D API for high throughput and scalable access to Gene-Protein Isoform-Transcript-Structure mapping and the Protein Feature API for high throughput and scalable access to protein feature data.

## Pairwise Protein Isoform Sequence Alignment
For pairwise protein isoform sequence alignment, Genomics To Proteins portal uses Gotoh's optimization for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The implementation uses a gap open penalty of -12 and gap extend penalty of -1, as described in biopython based on Durbin et al's description. For isoform alignment, the implementation uses a mismatch penalty of -20 and a match reward of +1, as opposed to the BLASTP matrix commonly used for other peptides. The reason for this is that in the case of an isoform alignment for genetic interpretation, the purpose of the alignment is to identify identical sequences resulting from translation of the same exon shared between isoforms.

## Usage

```javascript
// Import the Needleman-Wunsch function from alignment.js
const { needlemanWunsch } = await import('./src/core/alignment.js');

// Define your protein sequences
let sequence1 = 'MALSASPCANGAGGAEGGAAAAGGAUGA';
let sequence2 = 'MLAVSAAAGAAGGAAAAGGAUGA';

// Define your scoring parameters
let gapOpen = -12;
let gapExtend = -1;

// Call the Needleman-Wunsch function with the specified arguments
let result = needlemanWunsch(sequence1, sequence2, { gapOpen, gapExtend });

console.log(result);

```

## Pocket annotations

For pocket detection, two methods are used on AlphaFold structures: fpocket, P2Rank. Various metadata are reported along with the prediction, described in the tables below.

### fpocket
- *Vincent Le Guilloux, Peter Schmidtke, and Pierre Tuffery. "Fpocket: an open source platform for ligand pocket detection." BMC bioinformatics 10 (2009): 1-11. [https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-168](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-168)*

In [fpocket](https://github.com/Discngine/fpocket), pockets are ranked according the the computed fpocket druggability score, and if a residue participates in multiple pockets, it is annotated with the pocket with the highest druggability score. fpocket computes the list of residues which form the boundaries of a pocket as part of its computation.

| Metadata field | Description | Range |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Rank | Numerical index of the pocket sorted by Druggability score (Rank 1 is the most "druggable") | 1 to N |
| Druggability score | Probability of the pocket being a drug-binding site | 0 to 1 |
| Pocket volume | The total cavity volume in Å<sup>3</sup> | > 0 |
| Mean pLDDT | Average AlphaFold confidence of pocket residues | 0 to 100 |

### P2Rank
- *Radoslav Krivak, and David Hoksza. "P2Rank: machine learning based tool for rapid and accurate prediction of ligand binding sites from protein structure." Journal of Cheminformatics 10 (2018): 1-12. [https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-018-0285-8](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-018-0285-8)*

[P2Rank](https://github.com/rdk/p2rank) detects binding sites by analyzing protein surface through generating SAS points (SAS=solvent-accessible surface) and assigning chemico-physical properties based on their surroundings. Ligandability score of individual points is determined by a machine learning model trained on a dataset of known protein-ligand complexes. Residues are labeled as binding based on ligandibility score of the surrounding SAS points.

| Metadata field | Description | Range |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Rank | Numerical index of the pocket sorted by Probability score (Rank 1 is the most likely binding site) | 1 to N |
| Probability | Probability of pocket being a ligand-binding site | 0 to 1 |
| Mean pLDDT | Average AlphaFold confidence of pocket residues | 0 to 100 |

### AF2Bind
- *Artem Gazizov, Anna Lian, Casper Goverde, Jody Mou, Sergey Ovchinnikov, and Nicholas F. Polizzi. "AF2BIND: predicting small-molecule binding sites using the pair representation of AlphaFold2." Nature Methods 23 (2026): 626–635. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-026-03011-2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-026-03011-2)*

To predict protein-ligand binding sites, [AF2Bind](github.com/sokrypton/af2bind) uses the internal representation of [AlphaFold2](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). On top of the input protein structure, AF2Bind uses 20 "bait" amino acids as surrogates for a small-molecule ligand to extract binding signals in the absence of a true ligand. The probability of a residue being part of a binding site is determined by the model's confidence in the interaction between the protein's residues and these virtual baits.

| Metadata field | Description | Range |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Rank | Numerical index of the pocket | 1 to N |
| Residue probability | Probability of residue being a part of a ligand-binding site | 0 to 100 |
| Mean pLDDT | Average AlphaFold confidence of pocket residues | 0 to 100 |
